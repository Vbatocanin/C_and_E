## Mathematical proof of Algorithm Correctness and Efficiency

### Introduction

When designing a completely new algorithm, a very thorough analysis of it's **correctness** and **efficiency** is needed. The last thing you would want is your solution not being adequate for a problem it was **designed** to solve in the first place. 

In this article we will be talking about the following subjects:

- [Mathematical Induction](#mathematicalinduction)

- [Proof Of Correctness](#proofofcorrectness)
- [Example: Loop Invariants](#exampleloopinvariants)
- [Recurrence Relations: Linear and Non-Linear](#recurrencerelationslinearandnonlinear)
- [Solving Homogeneous Linear Recurrence Relations](#solvinghomogeneouslinearrecurrencerelations)
- [Computer Science Master Theorem](#computersciencemastertheorem)
- [Example: Dynamic Programming](#exampledynamicprogramming)
- [Example: Binary Search](#examplebinarysearch)



**FAIR WARNING**: as you can see from the section titles, this is not in any shape or form meant for direct application, this is pure `Computer Science Theory`, and is only meant for deeper understanding of certain fields of practical programming.
